# The Gameplan

### 1. Create a responsive web application to host translated 5e Content to Kobold Press's Black Flag Project & Fabula Ultima.
Must be responsive on most screen sizes and adhere mostly to Material Design conventions. Artwork for content must be AI generated and conform to the themes of the website.

### 2. Add user authentication and the ability to save collections of content to the user's profile.
User should be able to have several different librarieries or collections to refer back to.

### 3. Make content searchable by system, author, type of content, and other system specific parameters.
